# Time-series-forecasting-for-Sunspots
This project implements time series forecasting using the Facebook Prophet module to predict sunspot activity. Sunspots, temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere, exhibit an 11-year solar cycle. The analysis leverages daily, monthly, and yearly sunspot datasets to explore their behavior and forecast future activity.
